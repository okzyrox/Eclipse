- [ ] Check for closing window actions (Event????)
- [ ] Add threads / threading system to reduce load in larger projects on CPU
- [ ] More features:
    - [x] Basic Events
    - [ ] Shader loading, unloading, etc (can be used on Games, scenes, UI and entities)
    - [ ] Better global UI
    - [ ] Keymapping, etc (keymapping done through saving)
    - [ ] Data saving and loading
    - [ ] Popup windows
    - [ ] Images, loading tilemaps, loading animated sprites, etc
    - [ ] Loading videos, gifs, etc
    - [ ] Built in physics engine (for entitys)
    - [ ] SolidParts (entity that does not move, collides with other entities, canot be moved: aka a wall)
    - [ ] Collision by Z Index

- [ ] Register input better:
    - [x] Maybe make seperate functions for detecting input types, like press, hold, release, etc.
    - [ ] Add debounce system to reduce issues with key spam
- [ ] Add Components:
    - Components are attached to entities, scenes, parts, etc. They are run every time the parent of the component is updated or drawn.
    - [x] Script Components (scripts that are run on the entity, such as a gravity script, or collider script)
    - [ ] Shader Component (applys a shader)
- [ ] Add UI Components (seperate from ScriptComponents, ShaderComponents, etc):
    - [ ] Frame (used to encapsulate a list of UI Elements, which are positioned and scaled based on the frame size)
    - [ ] Seperation of Button and TextButton
    - [ ] Inputs: 
        - [ ] TextInput 
        - [ ] IntInput
        - [ ] FloatInput
        - [ ] IntSlider
        - [ ] FloatSlider
        - [ ] KeyInput
        - [ ] KeySelect (from a list)
        - [ ] Dropdown (strings)
        - [ ] Dropdown (Resolutions)
        - [ ] Dropdown (Enums) 
- [ ] Make more examples for the features:
    - [x] Input
    - [ ] UI
    - [ ] Scenes, Scene switching, scene management

    - [ ] Entities (creation, deletion), assignment of script components, etc

- [ ] Add template / starter projects
- [ ] Integrations with service provider APIs (Steam, Epic, etc)
- [ ] Give programmable control to the eclipse window (such as moving, resizing, fullscreen, etc)
- [ ] Add more components: audio, sprites, scripting (for entities), etc
- [ ] Loading data from a `assets` folder (fonts, images, gifs, videos, spritemaps, etc)
